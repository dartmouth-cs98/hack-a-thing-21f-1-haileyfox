# iOS App 


## What you built? 

I attempted to build an iOS app called Scrumdinger. The purpose of the app was to help users manage their daily "scrums", which are defined as short, daily meetings in which all members give an overview of their project statuses, the tasks they accomplished the previous day, their plan for the current day, and any problems they think they may encounter with their tasks. The purpose of the app is to ensure that these meetings are efficient and timely. The app has visual/audio cues indicating how much time each speaker has left in order to end on time. 

Include some screenshots.

## Who Did What?

I worked on this project alone, so I did everything. 

## What you learned

I feel like I have learned a lot about how apps are developed. I have never taken any kind of app development or web development course, and I have always really wanted to know how to do this on my own. I first had to learn about the Swift programming language in order to make the app. I had no previous knowledge of this language, so I read the article suggested on the tutorial as well as some other articles to have a better understanding of the language.

I followed the Apple iOSApp Dev tutorial https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/getting-started-with-scrumdinger. It was an extremely helpful tutorial. In addition, I read the following articles to learn about the Swift programming language: https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html, https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html

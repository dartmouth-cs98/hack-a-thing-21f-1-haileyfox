# iOS App 


## What you built? 

I attempted to build an iOS app called Scrumdinger. The purpose of the app was to help users manage their daily "scrums", which are defined as short, daily meetings in which all members give an overview of their project statuses, the tasks they accomplished the previous day, their plan for the current day, and any problems they think they may encounter with their tasks. The purpose of the app is to ensure that these meetings are efficient and timely. The app has visual/audio cues indicating how much time each speaker has left in order to end on time. 

Include some screenshots.

## Who Did What?

I worked on this project alone, so I did everything. 

## What you learned

I have learned a lot about how apps are developed. I have never taken any kind of app development or web development course, and I have always really wanted to know how to do this on my own. I have always felt a bit insecure about not knowing what seemingly commonplace terms meant, such as front-end and back-end development. After reading an article about the overview of iOS app development, I was able to have a better general overview of the process (article cited in acknowledgements). I then decided to follow Apple's iOS app development tutorial. The first step in this tutorial was learning how to use the Swift programming language which was the language used to make the app. I had no previous knowledge of this language, so I read the article suggested on the tutorial as well as some other articles to have a better understanding of the language. I found this process to be reassuring, as the concepts and main components of the language were similar to the other languages I know. During devlopment, however, it was challenging to use a language that I had never used before, although I could understand the general conceptual ideas. Debugging was especially difficult because I often did not understand why a certain line of code was incorrect. With each section of the tutorial, I would follow the instructions and attempt to code what was being asked for. Usually, I still ended up with errors and had to look at their code to understand what I had done wrong. However, throughout development, I became better at being able to code the sections on my own. Something I found especially helpful was that at the end of each section of the tutorial there were short quizzes to test my understanding of what had just been accomplished. These really helped me to solidfy my understanding of how the language and the app development process generally worked. In addition to the Swift programming language, I had also never used Xcode before, so I felt like this project was especially helpful in helping me learn about this development environment. Throughout the tutorial, there were many tips for how to perform certain tasks more efficiently, for example, how to embed code in a VStack/HStack/ZStack with one click. I really enjoyed being able to visualize my progress by running the different files and thought it was super cool that I was able to interact with the app by hitting the "resume" button and then tapping the different tabs on the app. I was also able to learn how to debug in Scode which is something I use all the time. 

Some challenges I experienced involved not having certain files which were necessary for some of the features. For example, I didn't have the Color class and was unable to find it online, so some of the colors would not show up. I also struggled with certain sections, mostly because I don't have a fully complete understanding of Swift yet. 

Here is a screen recording of the app.

I followed the Apple iOSApp Dev tutorial https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/getting-started-with-scrumdinger. It was an extremely helpful tutorial. In addition, I read the following articles to learn about the Swift programming language: https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html, https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html, and https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html#ID55. I read an article about Xcode so that I could use this environment more efficiently: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode. Finally, I read about some general information on iOS app development: https://www.webilize.ca/Blog/Details/53/overview-of-the-ios-mobile-app-development-process.
